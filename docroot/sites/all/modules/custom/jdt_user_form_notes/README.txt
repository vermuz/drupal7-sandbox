Use form api to create a custom form that allows users to edit an existing
note which belongs to the user.
-->
Use hook_menu to create separate custom menu entries to pages that displays
each form.
-->
Ensure that only users with correct permissions can access these pages.

If you have completed task #10 correctly, you can leverage your custom api
functions on form submission to manipulate the database accordingly.
=============================================================
You do not need to display links anywhere on the page to add or edit notes.
Your reviewer will manually type URL's to add/edit notes.

- Modify the info file so the theme performs like a "custom" theme.
(Change the theme name to "DT Custom")
- Install, configure and then script the enable process.
Moving forward, this will serve as the theme for your site.

The module should start with the following:
1. Create a custom database table (hook_schema)
    - table should have the following columns
    (note_id, article_nid, author_uid, note_text)
    - ensure the column types make sense (int, string, float etc.)
2. Create standard permissions for working with these notes
(hook_permission) (ie adding notes, deleting notes etc)
3. Include a separate file that has CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
functions to manipulate your new database table, leveraging drupals database abstraction layer / classes.
